OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
SIMPLE CALCULATOR
This Python project is designed to create a simple, interactive calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. The program will prompt the user for input, ask for two numbers, and allow the user to select an operation from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Based on the userâ€™s choice, the program will perform the operation and display the result.

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to create a user-friendly Python application that performs arithmetic calculations. It will help the user understand how to:
Take input from the user.
Use conditional statements (if/else) to decide what operation to perform.
Implement basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Handle special cases like division by zero.
Return the result to the user in a readable format.
